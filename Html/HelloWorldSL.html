    <h1><b><u>Hello, World!</u></b></h1>
	<h2>Welcome to Sri Lanka</h2>
	<p> Sri Lanka is the pearl of the Indian Ocean.Sri Lanka is an island nation located in the Indian Ocean,
	just off the southeastern coast of India. Despite its modest size—slightly larger than the state of 
	West Virginia—Sri Lanka has a population of about 20 million people, almost equal to the population of
	Texas. The island is rich in natural resources, and has a diverse economy based on agriculture, mining,
	fishing, manufacturing, and tourism. On becoming an independent nation in 1948 Sri Lanka (formerly called Ceylon) seemed to be headed for a future as a stable and prosperous democracy. Since the 1970s, however, the country has been torn by violent struggles between the two main ethnic groups, Sinhalese and Tamils, that make up its population. Sri Lanka suffered severe damage and loss of life from the tsunami of 2004; 
	what effect that disaster will have on the country’s political future remains to be seen.</p>
